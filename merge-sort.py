Extensions:
================
Bottom-up merge sort
================
Faster merge. Implement a version of merge() that copies the second half of a[] to aux[] in decreasing order and then does the merge back to a[]. This change allows you to remove the code to test that each of the halves has been exhausted from the inner loop. Note: the resulting sort is not stable.
================
Improvements. Write a program MergeX.java that implements the three improvements to mergesort that are described in the text: add a cutoff from small subarrays, test whether the array is already in order, and avoid the copy by switching arguments in the recursive code.
================
Inversions. Develop and implement a linearithmic algorithm Inversions.java for computing the number of inversions in a given array (the number of exchanges that would be performed by insertion sort for that arrayâ€”see Section 2.1). This quantity is related to the Kendall tau distance; see Section 2.5.
================
Index sort. Develop a version of Merge.java that does not rearrange the array, but returns an int[] perm such that perm[i] is the index of the ith smallest entry in the array.
